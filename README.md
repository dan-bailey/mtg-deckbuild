# mtg-deckbuild
Script that takes your card list from Lion's Eye in CSV and checks it against Archidekt to show you what decks you can build with your library.  Uses Scryfall, and a Lion's Eye export file.

## usage
'''python script.py <archidektID>'''

## to-do list
* clean up reporting
* cache OracleIDs locally so I don't need to re-pull via API every time
